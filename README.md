# Device-Price-Prediction

This repository contains work for device prediction using machine learning algorithms. The training and testing data can be found in the dataset folder.Â The necessary EDAs are done, and then some data processing is followed up. To achieve the best result, several machine learning algorithms are trained with a grid search approach. All these things can be found in the Jupyter notebook.
